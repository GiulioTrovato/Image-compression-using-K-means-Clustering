# Image-compression-using-K-means-Clustering

## Usage
* Load an image (e.g., 'bird_small.png')

* Preprocess the image into a suitable format (flatten pixel array)

* Run K-Means clustering on the pixel data

* Replace each pixel with its cluster centroid color

* Display original and compressed images side by side

## Applications
This technique can be used for:

* Reducing image file sizes

* Creating artistic effects with limited color palettes

* Preprocessing for image analysis tasks

* Efficient storage of images in memory-constrained environments
